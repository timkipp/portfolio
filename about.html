            <h1>Creativity and Compassion are the Sparks that Ignite My Passion</h1>
            <p>Creativity and compassion have always been the driving forces behind my passion. From a young age, I found joy in expressing myself through various forms of artistic expression, including drawing, music, and performance. This innate desire to create has remained a constant throughout my life, shaping my interests and aspirations. Whether it was creating and drawing cartoon characters, designing intricate floor plans for houses, or singing and dancing in high school and community theater musicals, I am fueled by the thrill of bringing ideas to life and making meaningful contributions through my creativity. I’m also passionate about making meaningful contributions that make the world a better place. I love learning about history and it was my exposure to our troubled but storied past that taught me to deplore discrimination and inequity and to cherish the values of freedom and equality—awakening in me a sense of justice. Inspired by the courageous individuals throughout history, from the founding fathers to the abolitionists, from the suffragettes to the civil rights heroes, following my bliss means enlisting my creativity to make my own mark on the world, leaving it a more enlightened and just place for future generations.</p>
            <h1>I Excel at the Intersection of Design, Development, and a Desire to Do Good in the World</h1>
            <p>My journey to find the thing I’m best at is fueled by a combination of creativity, technical proficiency, and a deep-rooted passion for making a difference. Through years of exploration and self-discovery, I found I had an eye for graphic design and a mind for programming. When I went back to school to hone my skills in visual design and database/web development, I realized this unique combination positions me to excel in the field of web development. I have a knack for crafting visually pleasing designs and creating unique software patterns to meet coding challenges, allowing me to create immersive and user-friendly digital experiences. With each project, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible and deliver results that not only meet but exceed expectations.</p>
            <h1>Changing the World Through Creative Contributions</h1>
            <p>My economic engine is driven by my ability to leverage my creative talents and technical expertise to deliver engaging designs and useful applications that help teach history and advocate the causes I believe in. I am passionate about using my skills to work for organizations or non-profits dedicated to social justice causes. By combining my passion for design with my skills in programming, I aim to create impactful websites and digital platforms that amplify voices, raise awareness, and drive positive social change. As I continue to refine my craft and expand my skill set, I am confident that I can build a successful career doing what I love.</p>
